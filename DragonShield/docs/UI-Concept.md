# UI Concept

## Editing

- Asset Class Allocation rows now include a persistent pencil button within the Target column.
- Double-clicking a row or pressing **Enter** / **Space** when focused opens the Target-Editor side panel.
- The active row highlights with a soft blue background while editing.
- The editor now opens inline below the row with a white background and fields for tolerance %.
