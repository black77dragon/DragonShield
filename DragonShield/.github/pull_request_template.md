## Summary

## Checklist
- [ ] I validated that any new or updated table view uses the Dragon Shield table UX pattern (search header, column controls, draggable columns with persisted widths/font).
- [ ] I updated documentation/code comments when behaviour changed.
- [ ] I ran the relevant tests or builds (`xcodebuild -scheme DragonShield` or equivalent) before requesting review.

> Refer to docs/UX_UI_concept/dragon_shield_ui_guide.md for the table UX standard.
